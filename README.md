This is a personality test app that will allow the user to take personality tests and save the results to their account.

At first, there will be only one test, an abbreviated version of the narcissistic personality inventory.  The ten questions will be presented with radio buttons, and upon hitting submit, the user will be prompted to create an account in order to see the results of the test.  

Future features may include additional tests, a way to compare your results with the average user in the database, or a way to email yourself the results.
